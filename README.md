## Proposal for further use
This code can effectivly be used for any election that has data around county and candidate in the correct structured CSV. a few ways we could modify this script to accomadate other elections would include changing county to track each state in a large scale election or restructuring the criteria to allow for ranked choice voting to alter the methods in which the winner is identified. Additionally, we could get more granular with the data and break down the county by individual neighborhoods to understand voting trends on a deeper level.
